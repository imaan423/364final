I am creating an application called Movie Mood. Movie Mood allows users to register and sign in, and enter movie titles that they can then save to their account. Users can see all the possible movie titles and director names they (and other users) have saved. Movies and Directors will have a many-to-many relationships - since there can be multiple directors for a movie, and a directors can direct multiple movies. Movie Mood will also allow logged-in users enter and save their favorite celebrity movie stars. Users can see all the favorite celebrity names they have saved but can't see other users' favorite celebrity names. Also logged-in users are able to search for a movie and receive the movie title along with the movie overview - by using data from TheMovieDB's API to gather data about the searched movie. I also used AJAX to send a request to TheMovieDB to get a movie's rating. I then displayed the rating when a user searched for a movie.
